    "text": "Senior Biostatistician July 2017- Until now\n\n\nAs a data analyst and scientist, I have developed and applied various data analysis skills in my projects, such as STEPS2021 and IQCAMP. Some of my main data analysis skills are:\n\nData cleaning using R programming and STATA software: I use R programming to perform data cleaning tasks, such as transforming, filtering, merging, and reshaping data. I use packages such as dplyr, tidyr, lubridate, and stringr to manipulate data frames, dates, and strings. I also use STATA software to import, export, and manage data from different sources and formats.\nData visualization using ggplot2 and plotly: I use ggplot2 package in R to create * high-quality and customizable plots and charts that display the patterns and trends in the data. I use plotly package in R to create interactive and dynamic visualizations that allow users to explore the data in different ways.\nPreparing automated report generators: I use R Markdown and knitr packages in R to create reproducible reports that combine code, results, and text. I use parameters, templates, and loops to automate the report generation process for different data sets and scenarios.\nPreparing statistical analysis for scientific papers: I use R programming and STATA software to conduct various statistical analyses for scientific papers, such as descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, regression models, survival analysis, and mixed-effects models\n\nI have used these data analysis skills in my projects as a main statistician. For example, in STEPS2021 and IQCAMP projects, I was involved in all stages of the survey study, from the design to the final report. I used R programming and STATA software to clean, analyze, and visualize the survey data. I also used R Markdown and knitr packages to create automated report generators that produced summary tables and graphs for each province."

I am skilled in R programming, data wrangling, statistical analysis, visualization, making dashboards using Shiny and power BI, and reporting. I am also an expert in training and capacity-building on R and STATA.\nI have many soft skills that make me a valuable team member and a good researcher. I have attention to detail, especially in data and values. I am a self-learner and I can quickly and independently learn new skills and tools. I am curious and eager to learn new things and expand my knowledge. I have good problem-solving skills and I love working with data. I enjoy finding patterns, trends, and insights from data that can inform decisions and actions. I am a team player and I enjoy collaborating with others. I value feedback and constructive criticism as opportunities to improve myself. I am eager for new challenges and experiences."

We aim for this report to be of use to Iran’s health policymakers. We used Iran’s COVID-19 registration system through hospital portal. Our data covered almost 16 months in the pandemic and included over 1.5 million registered COVID-19 patients with their demographics, previous histories, and their disease outcomes."
