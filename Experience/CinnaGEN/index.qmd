As a Biostatistician and data snientist at CinnaGen biotechnology company, I perform various tasks related to data analysis and visualization for clinical trials and research projects. Some of my main job duties are:


* Clinical trial data analysis: I use R programming to conduct statistical analysis on clinical trial data, such as descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, regression models, survival analysis, and mixed-effects models. I also ensure the quality and validity of the data and the results by following the standard operating procedures and guidelines.
* Statistical programming using R: I use R programming to create, modify, and maintain scripts and programs that perform data manipulation, processing, and reporting. I also use R to create custom functions and packages that automate and streamline the workflow and enhance the functionality of the existing tools.
* Sample size calculation: I use R programming to calculate the appropriate sample size for different types of studies, such as randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses. I also consider the factors that affect the sample size, such as the effect size, power, significance level, and variability.
* Statistical consultancy for non-statistical researchers and staff: I provide statistical advice and guidance to researchers and staff who are not familiar with statistics or R programming. I help them understand the basic concepts and principles of statistics, design and plan their studies, choose and apply the suitable statistical methods, interpret and communicate the results, and troubleshoot any issues or problems they encounter.
* Making web applications to create user-friendly statistical tools for non-statistician researchers: I use Shiny package in R to create interactive web applications that allow researchers to perform statistical analysis and visualization without coding. I design the user interface and the server logic of the web applications, and deploy them on Positâ€™s hosting service or on our own servers.

<a href="https://naser-ahmadi.shinyapps.io/Comparability-group/" target="_blank">Statistical package for biosimilar study analysis 2</a>
* Making dashboard using Power BI and shiny: I use Power BI and shiny to create dashboard that display key metrics and indicators of our clinical trials and research projects. I connect them to various data sources, such as Excel files, databases, or web services. I also use Power BI and shiny to create charts, graphs, maps, tables, and other visual elements that illustrate the data in an effective and appealing way.
