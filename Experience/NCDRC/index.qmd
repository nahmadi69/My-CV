As a data analyst and scientist, I have developed and applied various data analysis skills in my projects, such as STEPS2021 and IQCAMP. Some of my main data analysis skills are:

 * Data cleaning using R programming and STATA software: I use R programming to perform data cleaning tasks, such as transforming, filtering, merging, and reshaping data. I use packages such as dplyr, tidyr, lubridate, and stringr to manipulate data frames, dates, and strings. I also use STATA software to import, export, and manage data from different sources and formats.
 
 * Data visualization using ggplot2 and plotly: I use ggplot2 package in R to create * high-quality and customizable plots and charts that display the patterns and trends in the data. I use plotly package in R to create interactive and dynamic visualizations that allow users to explore the data in different ways.
 * Preparing automated report generators: I use R Markdown and knitr packages in R to create reproducible reports that combine code, results, and text. I use parameters, templates, and loops to automate the report generation process for different data sets and scenarios.
 
 * Preparing statistical analysis for scientific papers: I use R programming and STATA software to conduct various statistical analyses for scientific papers, such as descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, regression models, survival analysis, and mixed-effects models
 
I have used these data analysis skills in my projects as a main statistician. For example, in STEPS2021 and IQCAMP projects, I was involved in all stages of the survey study, from the design to the final report. I used R programming and STATA software to clean, analyze, and visualize the survey data. I also used R Markdown and knitr packages to create automated report generators that produced summary tables and graphs for each province.
