# **Naser Ahmadi**

**Biostatistician and Data Analyst.**



::: {style="text-align: justify"}
I am a public health data scientist with a master's degree in biostatistics from Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. I have more than 12 years of data analysis experience, of which 5 years are informal and more than 7 years are formal in the non-communicable diseases research center; I worked on national and international projects funded by the WHO and the Ministry of Health in Iran. I am skilled in R programming, data wrangling, statistical analysis, visualization, making dashboards using Shiny and Power BI, and reporting. I am also an expert in training and capacity-building on R and STATA.

I have many soft skills that make me a valuable team member and a good researcher. I have attention to detail, especially in data and values. I am a self-learner and I can quickly and independently learn new skills and tools. I am curious and eager to learn new things and expand my knowledge. I have good problem-solving skills and I love working with data. I enjoy finding patterns, trends, and insights from data that can inform decisions and actions. I am a team player and I enjoy collaborating with others. I value feedback and constructive criticism as opportunities to improve myself. I am eager for new challenges and experiences.
