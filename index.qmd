# **Naser Ahmadi**

**Data scientist and Biostatistician.**

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
I am a public health data scientist with a master's degree in biostatistics from Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. I have six years of experience in various national and international projects funded by WHO and the Ministry of Health in Iran. I am skilled in R programming, data wrangling, statistical analysis, visualization, and reporting. I am also an expert in training and capacity-building on R and STATA.

I have many soft skills that make me a valuable team member and a good researcher. I have attention to detail, especially in data and values. I am a self-learner and I can quickly and independently learn new skills and tools. I am curious and eager to learn new things and expand my knowledge. I have good problem-solving skills and I love working with data. I enjoy finding patterns, trends, and insights from data that can inform decisions and actions. I am a team player and I enjoy collaborating with others. I value feedback and constructive criticism as opportunities to improve myself. I am eager for new challenges and experiences.
